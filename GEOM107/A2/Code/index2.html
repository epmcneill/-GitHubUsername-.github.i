			<p>I have always been passionate about nature and have shaped my career to study and protect it. I obtained a BSc in Zoology and a MSc in Ecology both from the Univeristy of Guelph. I have had the pleasure of working in several continents throughout the world to study and address pertinent
			wildlife conservation issues. Each and every protected area I have worked in is unique and thus allowed me the opporunity to practice a diversity of approaches to solving these issues. However, one common aspect
			within all projects of my work was the application of geomatics. To put it simply, I love the work involved with geomatics and recognize the crucial role it plays to successful delivery of a conservation program.
			For these reasons I have decided to develop my skills further in this discipline by enrolling in the GIS - Cartographic Specialist graduate program at Fleming College, Ont, Canada.</p>
			<p>In my spare time I enjoy practicing wildlife photography. Please feel free to take a look at some of my photos!</p>

			<h3>Manas Tigers</h3>
			<p>Panthera's Tigers Forever program identified several key tiger recovery sites accross Asia
				requiring strong support to mitigate the threats they face. My first assignment in this program
				was at Manas National Park, India, where I specialized in working with anti-poaching law
				enforcement stakeholders in the field to understand and tailor responses to wildlife threats.
				In my role as an analyst within the site-based analytical team, we supported anti-poaching law
				enforcement personnel by providing detailed analyses of wildlife crime patterns, evaluations
				of operational outcomes, strategic planning, training, and technological support.</p>

			<img class="p1image" alt="Field Sensors title page" src="../Images/smart_field_sensors.png">
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Field Sensors</h3>
			<p>The Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) is open source software providing
				site-based conservation programs the means to manage patrol data effectively. Over
				the last decade field sensors (e.g. camera-traps and acoustic detectors) have become
				an increasingly important anti-poaching law enforcement tool, thus warranting the
				need for development on a field-sensor data specific management system. In my
				position on the SMART User's Council, I authored the first handbook covering the 
				use and capabilites of the newly developed SMART Field Sensors Plugin. In addition
				to this I was involved in implementing the first version of Field Sensors in Malaysia 
				and providing feedback.</p>

		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Operation Wallacea Honduras</h3>
			<p>Operation Wallacea runs a diverse research program in the cloud forests of El Cusuco National
				Park, Hounduras, which is a biodiversity hotspot possessing an exceptional number of
				endemic species. Over two field seasons as camera trapping scientist I hiked over the
				mountaineous terrain setting up camera-traps to estimate population densities of elusive
				mammalian megafauna with a special focus on Baird's Tapir (Tapirus bairdii). Due to threats
				such as deforestation and poaching, the estimates we recieve from camera-trapped images
				provide a baseline to evaluate population health over time.</p>

		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Woodland Caribou Recovery</h3>
			<p>As part of Ontario's Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), I researched 
				patterns of caribou forage selection accross multiple spatiotemporal scales in
				northern Ontario. Ground vegetation surveys were performed at the locations
				where caribou were known to have foraged in as determined from the hundreds of 
				hours of animal-borne video footage. Resource selection functions were estimated 
				to determine the nature of foraging selection patterns accross space and time, 
				providing a framework to better understand how we evaulaute which resources are
				critical for the peristence of a population.</p>
