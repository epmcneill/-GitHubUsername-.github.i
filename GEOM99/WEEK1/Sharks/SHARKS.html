    <p>For too long, the great white known as "Jaws" has been causing chaos accross the globe. Countless innocent beachgoers have been devoured by this beast. It is time to put an end to this madness. 
        Operation "Lock Up Jaws" is a global effort to scout our coastlines for signs of Jaws' presence. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, our ever vigilant shark spotters are keeping our beaches safe.
